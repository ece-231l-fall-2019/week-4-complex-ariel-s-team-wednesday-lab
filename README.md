# ECE 231 Week 4 Lab Assignment

This is (mostly) a group assignment except for Part 1 below. You can work on this assignment
with one other person. This is an opportunity to use and learn more features in GitHub,
specifically Issues and Pull Requests. I want to see communication between the team members
through the use of these features.

## Part 1: Recursion with pointers

In your personal repository for week 3, modify your binarysearch algorithm (the one which uses
pointers) to use recursion.

## Part 2: Complex number class

For this you will implement a complex number class as a team.  All functions in the provided
Complex.h file must be implemented. The method implementations must be in the Complex.cpp file.
